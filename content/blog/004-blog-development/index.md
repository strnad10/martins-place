## Introduction

As an IT person interested in technology, I did want to develop my blog by myself. I wasn‚Äôt keen on building it with a fancy web-based editor without any real customization options. I was thinking about a WordPress blog, but then I remembered that we had a class at middle school and I haven't had a good time customizing it. Also, it is not ideal from a security standpoint.

I wanted something simple-looking, fast, scalable, and secure, and was looking for a platform to build my blog.

Earlier this year, I came across a book called _How to take smart notes_. It led me into a rabbit hole of finding the most suitable note-taking app for my needs. I fell in love with [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) and got excited about Markdown, a simple and easy-to-use markup language. And so one of the things that the platform should've supported is to create posts in Markdown.

After searching for a while, I discovered Gatsby Framework and more importantly [Gatsby Starter blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

It was a simple, elegant blog template, which I could customize to suit my needs and ALSO it allowed me to create content in Markdown right out of the box. I was stoked. All it needed was a bit of tweaking with the bio and profile picture and I was done. \*_Or so I thought._\* Posts had a very simple structure and so I went ahead and created my first post. Its layout is displayed here but if you want to read it, you'll find it [here](../001-hello-world)

It was super simple. Almost a bit simpler than I'd like it to be. I wanted people to be able to filter at least by categories or tags. And so I got into my first customization project for this website.

## Tags

I wanted tags on the home page to be clickable links to a page with other posts with the same tag. I also wanted a page with all tags so people can see all the categories or tags. Conveniently, the Gatsby framework had a tutorial on how to do just that. And it was fairly simple.

### Add Metadata

The first thing I had to do is to add metadata to each index.md, which represents a post so I can work with tags, query them and so forth.

```txt

time: " min read"
tags: ["Post", "Blog", "Development"] # highlight-line

```

As you can see, it is a simple array of strings where each of them represents one tag. This array can be pulled from metadata (or _frontmatter_) of each index.md. 

### Query Metadata

To use field data, query it using GraphQL. All fields in frontmatter are available to query and put into some form using a custom React component.

```graphql
markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
  id
  excerpt(pruneLength: 160)
  html
  frontmatter {
    title
    date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
    description
    tags # highlight-line
  }
}
```

### Make a page to list tagged posts

The next step is to create a tags template in a './tags' directory which will list all posts tagged with said tag. All this page does is that it takes a tag and displays the total count of posts tagged with said tag.

![Tag page](04-posts-tagged.png)

Since this page is around 100 rows long, I'm not going to post it here. You can always find the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/strnad10/martins-place).

### Modify gatsby-node.js to render that page

The main method that renders all pages is _createPages_. I had to extend that method with the following code.

```js
const tags = result.data.tagsGroup.group

// Create tags pages
if (tags.length > 0) {
  tags.forEach(tag => {
    createPage({
      path: `/tags/${_.kebabCase(tag.fieldValue)}/`,
      component: tagsPage,
      context: {
        tag: tag.fieldValue,
      },
    })
  })
}
```

### Make a page that shows all tagged posts

I also wanted to create a /tags page, that will list out all tags, followed by the number of posts with that tag. To do that, I had to create a completely new page _src/pages/tags.js_.

![Tags page](05-all-tags.png)

I used a fairly similar query to the one in step two. Then I used a result from that query to display tag names as a clickable link and the total post count.

```graphql
import * as React from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
import kebabCase from "lodash/kebabCase"

import { Link, graphql } from "gatsby"

import Bio from "../components/bio"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import Seo from "../components/seo"

const TagsPage = ({ data, location }) => {
  const siteTitle = data.site.siteMetadata?.title || `Title`
  const group = data.allMarkdownRemark.group

  return (
    <Layout location={location} title={siteTitle}>
      <Seo title="All Tags" />
      <h1>All Tags</h1>
      <ol style={{ listStyle: `none` }}>
        {group.map(tag => {
          const groupTitle = group.fieldValue

          return (
            <li key={groupTitle}>
              <article
                className="post-list-item"
                itemScope
                itemType="http://schema.org/Article"
              >
                <header>
                  <h2>
                    # highlight-start
                    <Link to={`/tags/${kebabCase(tag.fieldValue)}/`}>
                      {tag.fieldValue}
                    </Link>
                    # highlight-end
                  </h2>
                  # highlight-start
                  <small>Total count: {tag.totalCount}</small>
                  # highlight-end
                </header>
              </article>
            </li>
          )
        })}
        <li>
          <article
            className="post-list-item"
            itemScope
            itemType="http://schema.org/Article"
          >
            <header>
              <h2>
                <Link to="/">Back to all posts</Link>
              </h2>
            </header>
          </article>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <footer>
        <Bio />
      </footer>
    </Layout>
  )
}

TagsPage.propTypes = {
  data: PropTypes.shape({
    allMarkdownRemark: PropTypes.shape({
      group: PropTypes.arrayOf(
        PropTypes.shape({
          fieldValue: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
          totalCount: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        }).isRequired
      ),
    }),
    site: PropTypes.shape({
      siteMetadata: PropTypes.shape({
        title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      }),
    }),
  }),
}

export default TagsPage

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
    # highlight-start
    allMarkdownRemark(limit: 2000) {
      group(field: frontmatter___tags) {
        fieldValue
        totalCount
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
`
```

### Adding tags to the main page

Lastly, I modified the main page to show tags under the date of each post, which included some query changes, some link adding and also a bit of CSS.

![Tags on the main page](06-tags-on-main-page.png)

If you wonder, '_JEEZ! Martin, how did you create those beautiful tags?_' The answer to that is CSS magic.

```css
.tag {
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 0 .5rem;
  margin-left: var(--spacing-3);
  color: white;
  background: #005b99;
  border-radius: 6px;
}
```

### The result

Since I initially introduced tags to my blog, a lot has changed. I polished tags a bit and added them to blog posts themselves.

![Tags in post](07-tags-in-post.png)

I also created a subscribe form for you guys to subscribe to notifications of when I release a new post. I added code snippets to my blog as well, just to learn that it already was in some way integrated and I had to learn to render them properly.

This post is getting a bit longer than I thought. I'll have to end my development report here and leave you wondering what I did to create such an amazing subscribe form. You should BTW use it. üòÅ It'll make my day.
