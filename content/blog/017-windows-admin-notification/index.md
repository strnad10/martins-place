## Long time, no see, ey? 😁

I asked a ChatGPT how to apologize for not posting for a long time and this is how it responded. Had to share it with you:

> "Dear readers, I apologize for not gracing your screens with my words of wisdom for the past three months. I was busy living my life in 3D and forgot that there's a whole 2D world out there waiting for me to share my thoughts with."

The real reason is that during the winter, I watched a lot of road cycling videos and developed a strong interest in the sport. I went online and searched for second-hand components, purchased them, and built my first carbon road bike, which I fell in love with immediately. That's why I was unable to find time to post anything due to my constant travels on the road. But that's not the main point of this post. Let's get to it.

## Windows admins can stay up to date more easily

Microsoft has introduced a new feature that allows Windows administrators to receive email notifications when new issues are added to the Windows release health section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. By signing up for this service, administrators will receive email notifications whenever known issues are updated, including changes in status, new workarounds, or issue resolutions. However, this feature is only available for those with admin roles in organizations that have eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 for Business subscriptions that provide access to Windows release health in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

To enroll in this feature, ask your global administrator to assign you a role to access Microsoft 365 admin portal and follow these steps. 
1) Log in to the Microsoft 365 admin center
2) Locate [Windows release health](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/windowsreleasehealth) under the Health menu
3) Select **Preferences** > **Email**
4) Then select **Send me email notifications about Windows release health**.
5) Specify the *email address* for the notifications and *Windows versions* to be notified about.

> NOTE: Each admin account can specify up to two email addresses under their email preferences.

6) Select **Save** when you're finished. It may take up to *8 hours* for these changes to take effect.

You can also watch a [very nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSD7fYyodC4) from **Windows IT Pro** on youtube.

It is important to note that this feature is only available for specific subscriptions, including Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3/A3/F3, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5/A5, Windows 10 Enterprise E3/A3, Windows 10 Enterprise E5/A5, Windows 11 Enterprise E3/A3, or Windows 11 Enterprise E5/A5.

It is worth noting that if a particular issue affects multiple versions of Windows, you will only receive one email notification. Therefore, you can enroll for multiple Windows versions without worrying about receiving an excessive number of notifications. Additionally, you can customize your notification settings by visiting the Windows release health page, selecting "Preferences," and indicating the Windows versions you want to be notified about, the email addresses you have enrolled, or opting out of these email notifications altogether.

If you found this post on Microsoft 365 to be helpful, consider sharing it with your friends and colleagues. Additionally, if you have any questions regarding Microsoft 365, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.

Have a wonderful spring. 😊

PS: My bike spec and how I build it will come out soon. 🚴
