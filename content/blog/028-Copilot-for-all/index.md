## Super-power to all, not just big businesses

Microsoft has opened up access to its AI-powered Office features, making Copilot for Microsoft 365 available to businesses of all sizes. Previously, the service required a commitment of at least 300 users and an additional cost of $9,000 for businesses. However, in response to demand from small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft has removed the 300-seat minimum.

Divya Kumar, the global head of marketing for search and AI at Microsoft, stated, ‚ÄúGiven the demand and interest we‚Äôve heard from small and medium-sized businesses, we‚Äôre removing that 300 seat minimum. So now businesses of all sizes can get the $30 option and enable Copilot in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

In addition to eliminating the 300-seat purchase requirement, Microsoft is also removing the need for specific Microsoft 365 plans. Copilot is now accessible within Office apps for Office 365 E3 and E5 customers. Subscribers of Microsoft 365 Business Standard or Business Premium can also purchase Copilot for Microsoft 365 at $30 per user per month.

While Copilot for Microsoft 365 maintains a relatively high entry price, Microsoft aims to revolutionize document creation and editing within Office apps. The AI-powered assistant, driven by GPT-4 from OpenAI, functions as a chatbot in the sidebar of Microsoft 365 apps. It can also be summoned inline, allowing users to generate text in documents, create PowerPoint presentations based on Word documents, and offer assistance throughout the editing process.

## How it works

The integration of Microsoft 365 Apps, encompassing Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and Loop, with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 aims to assist users within the specific context of their work. For instance, Copilot in Word is crafted to aid users in the creation, comprehension, and editing of documents, mirroring similar contextual support across other Microsoft 365 Apps.
